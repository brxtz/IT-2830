    <h1>My Favorite Video Games</h1>
    <h2>Rafael Bratfich de Oliveira - rb9cc</h2>
    <p>The games that I have picked here are all important for me, The Last of Us was a game that I bought at the time without knowing what I was getting into and I simply fell in love with it. League of Legends was the first PC game I ever played and it was also the first game I played online with friends. Last but not least, Modern Warfare 2 was the game that made me love with the Call of Duty franchise and I have nice memories of me and my cousin playing 1v1's on a splint screen!</p>
