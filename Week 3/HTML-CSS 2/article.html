    <h2>How to visit Portugal on a budget!</h2>
    <p>Figure out the cheapest way to reach Portugal
        Portugal has international airports in Lisbon, Porto and Faro. Be sure to check prices at each before booking, as you may find better deals arriving in one or the other. If you’re considering combining a trip to Portugal with Spain, you might find cheaper rates flying into Madrid or even Sevilla, which is a two-hour train ride away from Tavira in southern Portugal. Take public transportation from the airport
        Whether you arrive in Lisbon, Porto or Faro, you can start your trip right by foregoing a pricey taxi ride and taking a bus or the metro to your destination. Handy metro service runs to city centers from Lisbon (red line) or Porto (violet line E). Faro’s airport has a quality bus service operated by Vamus Algarve. The Aerobus runs into Faro and also to Albufeira, Portimão and Lagos. Make lunch your biggest meal 
        Many restaurants in Portugal offer good-value lunch specials. Always ask if there's a menu do dia (fixed menu) or prato do dia (daily special). Even high-end restaurants typically have lower-priced lunch menus.  
        In the evening, you can forego conventional dining for a picnic in the park, at a viewpoint or overlooking the seaside. A loaf of fresh bread, cheese, olives and a bottle of wine makes the perfect accompaniment to watching the sunset. Consider staying in a hostel
        Portugal has many of Europe’s most stylish hostels, some of which are set in historic buildings and feature upscale amenities like roof terraces, art-filled lounges or swimming pools. Rates start at around €22 per night ­– big savings over a traditional hotel. Many hostels also offer budget-friendly activities, like free walking tours or pub crawls and free or low-cost rentals of bikes, surfboards and other gear. Some even host communal dinners, which are a great way to meet other people while saving money in the process.</p>
